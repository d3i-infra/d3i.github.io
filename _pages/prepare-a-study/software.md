## Software

# The Next platform
You can configure a complete data donation participant flow on the Next platform. The [Next](https://next.eyra.co/) platform can be used through a Software-as-a-Service agreement with Eyra. Click [here](https://www.eyra.co/projects/data-donation) for more information about terms and pricing. 

As Next is available [open source](https://github.com/eyra/mono), we offer researchers in the Netherlands the opportunity to independently host the Next platform on SURF Research Cloud. 

# The donate task
Crucial in a data donation participant flow is the `donate task`. The donate task is executed by a Python script. 
You can create a Python script yourself using our [documentation](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/). We can offer you the following support: 
-	Help when you have questions or run into issues when developing your script. 
-	You can join our Slack community with other Python script developers.
-	We can build a custom Python script for your study (this is a paid service). 

Interested in using the Next platform or looking for support with your Python script? Please reach out to l.boeschoten@uu.nl.
