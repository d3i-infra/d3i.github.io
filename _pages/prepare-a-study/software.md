## How does our data donation software work?

Our software for data donation is called **Port**. Port consists of a number of 
elements, that together allow you to configure a data donation study according to 
the workflow explained [here](/data-donation/).

Port is a research tool specially developed for researchers to administer data donation studies to participants.

With Port you can:

* Configure your study; choose branding, host privacy policy, get consent from participants, invite participants to your study
* Create a data donation flow; steps the participant should follow in order to complete the donation
* Track the progress of your study

Port is part of the next plafrom [Next](https://next.eyra.co/) platform which is a collection of research tools.

Below you can find a diagram explaining Next and Port;

## Use Port for your data donation study

In order to use Port you need access to Next. You can use Next in 3 ways;

* Next as a Software-as-a-service product by Eyra
* Next on Surf Research Cloud
* Host Next yourself

It can be difficult to choose which one to use, in order to help you make a decision you can find a decision tree below:

## The donate task

With Port you can create a data donation flow. The most crucial part in a data donation flow is the "donate task"; the part where participants are going to donate their data.

The donate task is an application you can create yourself. Check out the [documentation](https://d3i-infra.github.io/data-donation-task/) for more information.

Interested? We can offer you the following support: 

-	Help when you have questions or run into issues when developing the data donation task. 
-	You can join our Slack community with other developers.
-   We can help and assist you in creating your own data donation task.
